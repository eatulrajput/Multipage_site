            <h2>Parkinson's Law</h2>

            <p class="quote">Parkinson's Law states that work expands to fill the time allocated to it.</p>

            <p>
                This law is actually true. During the winter vacation of 10 days in my 1st semester, I actually realised
                this phenomenon that my tasks have expanded with holidays, I hardly completed the tasks in the required
                time. My tasks completed till the end of the holidays. But, I regret about that I can utilise that time
                if I
                make a well structured plan for the holiday and execute the tasks in artficial deadlines (self created
                deadlines for the particular tasks). Otherwise the result isn't in my favour.

            <p class="quote">"Work expands as to fill the time available for its completion" :<i>Cyril Northcote
                    Parkinson</i> (1955)</p>

            <p>What Parkinson's law really means is that the more time you give yourself to complete a task the longer
                the
                task will take, and it will also increase in complexity!</p>

            <p>Say you set yourself a full day to study a subject. You'll start coming up with more complex ideas to
                incorporate into the task. Example of this is the infamous </p>

            <p><b>"I need to reorganize my desk completely in order to get more productive as I sit down and do my
                    work".</b>
            </p>

            <p>The task that should have taken an hour or two of studying, expanded to include reorganizing your desk,
                set the bed, take bath. Then you decided you should eat some snacks and watch something on Netflix where
                alot of hours gone. Now, you're exhausted and went to take some rest and now you woke up and decided to
                do some research on the best ways of study and then you are making notes on how to study and the day
                ended.</p>

            <p>A two hour task now took all day. and the task itself didn't happen until the end of day, when you felt
                the pressure that the day is almost over. We are all perfectionists at heart, add in some pure
                procrastination and you'll surely spend more time on the task.</p>

            <p>I spent a good 15 minutes looking for the right image to the paste above thats 15 minutes I could have
                spent finishing the article.</p>

            <h3>Other examples of Parkinson's law in action</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>You had all day to do packing for the trip yet you started 30 minutes before the time you are
                        supposed to leave.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>You had all semester to study a subject yet you only started studying it 2 days before the exam.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>You have bought your favourite author's book and decided that you will read and finish it in 10
                        days of winter vaction and when you have holidays you haven't started it reading and crying that
                        you didn't read that book yet.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>What is the solution then?</h3>
            <p>Deadline can be your friend if you really want to.</p>

            <p>The best approach which can work for you in a healthy way is to set yourself tighter deadlines to do
                things. Cut your deadline times in half and you'll double your productivity. Finding the ideal deadline
                for a task will take some trial and error. Just like anything in life, experiment with different
                deadlines for different tasks and iterate. You'll soon find yourself able to set very realistic
                deadlines and gain so much time back in your day or work day.
            </p>

            <p>Improving your productivity is very rewarding, as you finish more you'll get more kick of dopamine and
                in-force that habit. The only way to get better results is by taking action on that knowledge. Start now
                by setting yourself shorter deadlines for the different tasks you need to get done and enjoy the
                results!</p>
